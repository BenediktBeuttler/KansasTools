Bug: duplicate sentences in .txt file when extracting text from article
find code in crawler_for_snippet.py, lines 11-17

Problem 1:
The p tags contain the text. That's why:
"of any p tag get_text()"    (line 16 - 19) 
BUT: somehow p tags which do not contain children, are printed twice. 
Question: how to write code, that the text from a p tag is only printed once?



Problem 2: 
Some p tag contain children. e.g:
<p>
    <strong> Was bisher geschah </strong>
</p>

Approach: 
"if a p tag has children, get descandents and save them in list.
Get the text of the last element in list" (lines 20 -24)
BUT: somehow the text is still printed several times, depending on how many children there are 
Question: what do I oversee in my code that not the text of the last child is printed?
