Bug: duplicate sentences in .txt file when extracting text from article
lines 58 - 70

Situation:
The p tags contain the text. That's why:
"of any p tag get_text()" - works fine. 
BUT: If a p tag contains another tag as then the text will be printed twice. That leads to duplicate sentences in the text. 
Example:
<p>
    <strong> Was bisher geschah </strong> 
</p>

Output in .txt file: Was bisher geschah Was bisher geschah 

Question: 
how to write code for following:
"if p tag has descandents, get text only of "smallest" descandent"
