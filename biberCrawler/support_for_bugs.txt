1. print data in csv
lines 21 - 25, 
line 55 


with print statements I can see: 
- meta data is extracted from website
- the function "addToMetaFile"is runned. The print statement at the end of the function is executed

Problem: 
the function "addToMetaFile" doesn't print the passed variables (which contain meta data) nor plain text to the csv. 

Question: 
can anyone see why nothing is printed to the csv file?

PS: it has worked yesterday, but not anymore.
